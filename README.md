This repository contains a **curated and categorized list** of all the public projects available on my GitHub profile. ✨  
I’ve organized them into three clear categories so you can quickly see which projects are ready to use, which ones are actively being developed, and which ones are still in the idea stage.

## ✅ Ready to Use
